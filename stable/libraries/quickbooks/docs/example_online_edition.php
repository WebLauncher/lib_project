	// If you're using the 'Desktop' model of communication with QuickBooks OE,

	//	sign your CSR and send it back to you. You must provide a full path to 
	//	the concatenation of the private key file and the signed CSR. So, the

	//	-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
	//	-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
	//	... bla bla bla lots of stuff here ...
