Known issues:

1. built with xvid cvs. seems to work fine, if not i'm interested in what doesn't work. 

2. -flags trell  and -me have been removed.
use -trellis 1 and -me_method instead.

3. you can use presets under windows but use a full path to the preset,
-vpre "complete path\whaterver.ffpreset"
or if the preset file is in the same directory as ffmpeg 
-vpre "./whaterver.ffpreset"
e.g
ffmpeg -i input.avi -vcodec libx264 -vpre "path/libx264-max.ffpreset" out.mp4
